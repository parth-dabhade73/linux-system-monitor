# 🖥️ Linux System Monitor (DevOps Practice Project)

This is a simple bash-based system monitoring tool that logs **CPU**, **Memory**, and **Disk usage** at regular intervals. It’s designed for beginners exploring **Linux**, **shell scripting**, and **DevOps fundamentals**.

---

### 📌 Features

- Logs system usage with timestamps
- Appends data to a log file (`system_monitor.log`)
- Can be run in the background for continuous monitoring
- Great first project to practice:
  - Linux CLI & permissions
  - Shell scripting
  - Cron jobs (optional future extension)
  - Git/GitHub workflows

---

### ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Linux (Ubuntu on WSL)
- Bash
- Git & GitHub

---

### 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:parth-dabhade73/linux-system-monitor.git
cd linux-system-monitor

# 2. Make the script executable
chmod +x monitor.sh

# 3. Run the script
./monitor.sh
```

✅ It will create a `system_monitor.log` file and append new usage info every few seconds.
